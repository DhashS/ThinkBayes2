    "Bayes's Theorem proves to be extremely useful when building mobile robots that need to know where they are within an environment at any given time.  Because of the error in motion and sensor systems, a robot's knowledge of its location in the world is based on probabilities.  Let's look at a simplified example that could feasibly be scaled up to create a working localization model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part A:**  We have a robot that exists within a very simple environement.  The map for this environment is a row of 6 grid cells that are colored either green or red and each labeled $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.  In real life, a larger form of this grid environment could make up what is known as an occupancy grid, or a map of the world with places that the robot can go represented as green cells and obstacles as red cells.\n",
